\title{Template code functions for specific models}
\usage{
template_glmnet(formula, data, verbose = FALSE, tune = TRUE)

template_xgboost(formula, data, verbose = FALSE, tune = TRUE)

template_knn(formula, data, verbose = FALSE, tune = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A simple model formula with no in-line functions. This will
be used to template the recipe object as well as determining which outcome
and predictor columns will be used.}

\item{data}{A data frame with the columns used in the analysis.}

\item{verbose}{A single logical that determined whether comments are added to
the printed code explaining why certain lines are used.}

\item{tune}{A single logical that controls if code for model tuning should be
printed.}
}
\value{
Invisible \code{NULL} but code is printed to the console.
}
\description{
These functions make suggestions for code when using a few common models.
They print out code to the console that could be considered minimal syntax
for their respective techniques. Each creates a prototype recipe and workflow
object that can be edited or updated as the data require.
}
\details{
Based on the columns in \code{data}, certain recipe steps printed. For example, if
a model requires that qualitative predictors be converted to numeric (say,
using dummy variables) then an additional \code{step_dummy()} is added. Otherwise
that recipe step is not included in the output.

The syntax is opinionated and should not be considered the exact answer for
every data analysis. It has reasonable defaults.

\examples{
template_glmnet(Species ~ ., data = iris)
template_glmnet(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris, verbose = TRUE)
